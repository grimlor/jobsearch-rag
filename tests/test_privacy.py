    REQUIREMENT: The scoring pipeline makes no network calls to hosts
    other than the configured Ollama endpoint during scoring, embedding,
    and decision recording.

    WHO: The operator who chose this tool specifically because it
         does not send personal data to external services
    WHAT: (1) During a complete scoring pipeline run covering Scorer,
              Embedder, and VectorStore, the system makes no network
              calls to any host other than localhost.
          (2) The system does not send any JD text, resume text, or
              scoring data to external servers during the pipeline run.
    WHY: The privacy-first claim is the primary architectural differentiator.
         A test that can fail is a guarantee worth making; a README statement
         is not

    MOCK BOUNDARY:
        Mock:  _mock_ollama_client fixture (ollama AsyncClient — the I/O
               boundary); socket.create_connection monkeypatched to reject
               non-localhost connections
