"""Compensation parsing tests — extraction, normalization, and source detection.

Maps to BDD spec: TestCompensationParsing

The comp parser extracts salary ranges from JD text via regex, normalizes
hourly rates to annual (x2080), and records the source (employer-stated vs.
board-estimated).  All extraction happens on raw text — no LLM involvement.

class TestCompensationParsing:
    """REQUIREMENT: Compensation ranges are extracted from JD text and normalized.

    WHO: The pipeline runner enriching listings after JD extraction;
         the scorer computing comp_score
    WHAT: Annual salary ranges ($NNN,NNN or $NNNk) are extracted as comp_min/max
           floats; hourly rates ($NN/hr) are converted to annual via x2080;
          ranges expressed as "$180,000 - $220,000" produce both min and max;
          single values produce both min and max as the same number;
          the original text snippet is preserved in comp_text;
          JDs with no salary information produce None for all comp fields;
          the parser does not hallucinate numbers from non-salary contexts
          (e.g. "5,000 employees" is not a salary)
    WHY: Salary data is noisy and inconsistently formatted across boards;
         incorrect parsing would silently distort comp_score rankings —
         a wrong number is worse than a missing one
