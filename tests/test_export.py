"""Export tests — Markdown, CSV, and browser tab opener.

Maps to BDD specs: TestMarkdownExport, TestCSVExport, TestBrowserTabOpener

The export layer transforms ranked pipeline output into human-consumable
formats: Markdown tables (primary), CSV (spreadsheet import), and browser
tabs (immediate review).  All exporters receive ``RankedListing`` objects
produced by the Ranker — no adapter or RAG dependencies exist here.

    WHO: The operator who wants to review shortlisted roles without manually
         clicking through the ranked output
    WHAT: (1) The system opens browser tabs in descending score order so the highest-scored result appears first.
          (2) The system opens exactly the number of tabs specified by the `--open-top` CLI flag.
          (3) The system uses the `open_top_n` value from settings when the CLI does not provide `--open-top`.
          (4) The system opens all available results without error when fewer results exist than the requested top N.
          (5) The system excludes disqualified roles from browser tabs regardless of their position in the results.
          (6) The system logs a failed URL and continues opening the remaining tabs when one tab open raises an `OSError`.
          (7) The system opens no tabs and logs an advisory message when all results have zero scores.
          (8) The system opens tabs in the default system browser instead of the Playwright automation session.
          (9) The system opens no tabs and raises no error when `--open-top` is set to 0.
    WHY: The tab opener is the last mile of the workflow — an error here
         that aborts remaining tabs wastes the entire run's value;
