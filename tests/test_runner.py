    REQUIREMENT: The pipeline runner executes steps in correct order with proper error handling.

    WHO: The operator running a search; downstream consumers of RunResult
    WHAT: (1) The system performs the Ollama health check before it starts any board I/O during a run.
          (2) The system searches all enabled boards when no boards are explicitly specified.
          (3) The system searches only the explicitly specified board when a boards list is provided.
          (4) The system searches both enabled boards and overnight boards when overnight mode is enabled.
          (5) The system continues scoring listings from a healthy board and reports both boards when another board fails during authentication.
          (6) The system increments the failed listings count when scoring fails because the embed endpoint returns a non-retryable error.
          (7) The system returns a valid RunResult with empty ranked listings when a board search produces no listings.
          (8) The system passes successfully scored listings to the ranker and includes them in the summary counts.
          (9) The system does not search the same board twice when an overnight board overlaps with enabled boards.
          (10) The system auto-indexes only the empty collections when some collections are already populated.
          (11) The system skips auto-indexing for collections that already contain documents.
    WHY: A health check after browser work wastes time; a single board
         failure aborting the entire run discards valid results from other
         boards; an invalid RunResult crashes exporters downstream

    REQUIREMENT: Individual board search delegates correctly to adapter and session manager.

    WHO: The pipeline runner calling adapters through the session manager
    WHAT: (1) The system skips a board that has no config section and returns an empty result without error.
          (2) The system calls authenticate, search, and extract_detail in that order when a returned listing has empty full_text.
          (3) The system does not call extract_detail when a returned listing already has full_text populated.
          (4) The system excludes a listing whose extracted full_text is only whitespace and counts it as failed.
          (5) The system counts a listing as failed when extract_detail raises an ActionableError and still scores the other listing.
          (6) The system counts an unexpected exception during extract_detail as a failure without aborting the run.
          (7) The system continues to the next search URL after a search ActionableError and collects that URL's results successfully.
    WHY: A missing config crashing the run is a config error reported too late;
         a single extraction failure aborting the board discards all other
         results from that board's search

    REQUIREMENT: Empty collections are auto-indexed before scoring begins.

    WHO: The operator running search after a reset or on first use
    WHAT: (1) The system creates a real Indexer and indexes the resume and archetype collections when run() starts with an unpopulated store.
          (2) The system skips auto-indexing when collections are already populated and leaves the existing collection counts unchanged.
          (3) The system populates the collections through auto-indexing before scoring begins.
          (4) The system treats the collection as empty when collection_count raises ActionableError and runs real auto-indexing.
    WHY: Failing all 180 listings because the operator forgot to run a
         separate index command is a predictable situation with an obvious
         recovery — the system should just do it
