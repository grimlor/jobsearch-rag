"""
Compensation scoring tests — continuous scale, band boundaries, config integration.

Maps to BDD specs: TestCompensationScoring

The comp scorer converts parsed compensation data (comp_max) into a continuous
score in [0.0, 1.0] relative to a configurable base_salary target.  This is a
*taste signal* — it nudges rankings without hard-gating any role.

class TestCompensationScoring:
    """
    REQUIREMENT: Compensation score is a continuous signal relative to a
    configurable base_salary target, not a binary gate.

    WHO: The ranker consuming comp_score to nudge final ranking;
         the operator tuning base_salary in settings.toml
    WHAT: (1) The system assigns a compensation score of 1.0 when `comp_max` equals `base_salary`.
          (2) The system keeps the compensation score at 1.0 when `comp_max` exceeds `base_salary`.
          (3) The system places the compensation score in the 0.7 to 0.9 band when `comp_max` is 95% of `base_salary`.
          (4) The system assigns a compensation score of 0.7 when `comp_max` is exactly 90% of `base_salary`.
          (5) The system places the compensation score in the 0.4 to 0.7 band when `comp_max` is 85% of `base_salary`.
          (6) The system assigns a compensation score of 0.4 when `comp_max` is exactly 77% of `base_salary`.
          (7) The system places the compensation score in the 0.0 to 0.4 band when `comp_max` is 72% of `base_salary`.
          (8) The system assigns a compensation score of 0.0 when `comp_max` is exactly 68% of `base_salary`.
          (9) The system clamps the compensation score to 0.0 when `comp_max` falls below 68% of `base_salary`.
          (10) The system assigns a neutral compensation score of 0.5 when compensation data is missing.
          (11) The system reads `base_salary` from configuration by producing different scores for the same `comp_max` under different base salaries.
          (12) The system scales compensation thresholds proportionally with `base_salary` so that 90% of any configured base scores 0.7.
          (13) The system always keeps the compensation score within the inclusive range from 0.0 to 1.0.
          (14) The system increases the compensation score monotonically within a band through linear interpolation.
          (15) The system keeps the compensation scale continuous across band boundaries without score gaps or jumps.
    WHY: Compensation as a taste signal lets well-paying roles float up
         without hard-gating roles that might be stepping stones or have
         other attractive qualities — a gate would discard too aggressively
