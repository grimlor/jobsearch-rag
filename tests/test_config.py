    """REQUIREMENT: Configuration errors tell the operator exactly what to fix.

    WHO: The operator who misconfigured settings.toml
    WHAT: Each validation failure is caught at startup (not mid-pipeline)
          and produces an actionable error that names the problematic field,
          explains what is wrong, and provides step-by-step recovery guidance
          including which file to open and what to change; all config errors
          include a suggestion and troubleshooting steps
    WHY: A mid-run config failure after 10 minutes of browser work is
         far more costly than a startup validation failure — and an error
         that says "validation failed" without telling the operator what
         to fix is nearly as costly as a mid-run crash

        Mock:  nothing — uses real filesystem via tempfile.TemporaryDirectory
