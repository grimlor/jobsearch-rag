"""LinkedIn adapter extraction tests — overnight mode, stealth, throttled.

Spec classes:
    TestLinkedInAuthenticate — session verification with bot-detection awareness
    TestLinkedInSearch — job search pagination and listing extraction
    TestLinkedInExtractDetail — full JD extraction from listing detail pages

All tests are xfail until the adapter is implemented. The specs define
the delivery contract — each test becomes a regression gate once the
adapter is delivered.

LinkedIn specifics:
    - Aggressive bot detection requires headed mode + stealth patches
    - Wide throttle window (8-20s) to stay under radar
    - ``check_linkedin_detection`` guards every page navigation
    - Authwall, challenge, and session-invalidation are distinct failure modes
