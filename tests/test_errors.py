          (3) The system returns a connection error that includes the URL and connectivity troubleshooting guidance.
          (4) The system returns an embedding error that names the model and provides pull and verification guidance.
          (5) The system returns an index error that names the collection and provides rebuild guidance.
          (6) The system returns a parse error that names the board and selector and provides inspection steps.
