"""Indeed adapter extraction tests — high-volume board with aggressive bot detection.

Spec classes:
    TestIndeedAuthenticate — session verification and bot-detection handling
    TestIndeedSearch — search pagination and card extraction
    TestIndeedExtractDetail — full JD extraction from listing detail pages

All tests are xfail until the adapter is implemented. The specs define
the delivery contract — each test becomes a regression gate once the
adapter is delivered.

Indeed specifics:
    - High-volume board with aggressive bot detection (Akamai, DataDome)
    - May require stealth patches and careful throttling
    - CAPTCHA and challenge pages are common failure modes
    - Session persistence via cookie-based storage_state
