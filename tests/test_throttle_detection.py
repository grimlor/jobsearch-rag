"""
Throttle detection tests — ZipRecruiter rate-limit recognition and backoff.

Maps to BDD spec: TestThrottleDetection

Tests verify that the ZipRecruiter adapter recognizes throttle responses
("We encountered an error while loading this job"), applies exponential
backoff, skips after max retries, logs throttle events, and distinguishes
throttle text from legitimate JD content.

All behavioral tests exercise the public ``search()`` API rather than
internal click-through methods, asserting on returned listing state,
sleep calls, and log output.

    REQUIREMENT: Board-specific throttle responses are detected and handled
    gracefully rather than treated as valid JD text.

    WHO: The pipeline operator running automated searches
    WHAT: (1) The system recognizes the canonical ZipRecruiter error message as a throttle response.
          (2) The system does not falsely flag legitimate JD text or text that merely mentions error as a throttle response.
          (3) The system waits before retrying after it encounters a throttle response during search.
          (4) The system increases the backoff wait so the second delay is longer than the first on consecutive throttle responses.
          (5) The system skips a listing after the retry limit is exceeded and leaves `full_text` empty or at its fallback value.
          (6) The system counts a listing as a failed extraction after it exhausts all retries.
          (7) The system logs a throttle event at WARNING with the listing identifier.
          (8) The system populates the listing `full_text` with the real JD content when extraction succeeds after throttle backoff.
          (9) The system detects throttle text that appears after a timeout and retries with backoff.
          (10) The system uses empty fallback text after repeated late throttle responses exhaust all retries (no short_description in DOM flow).
          (11) The system falls back to empty text immediately when a timeout is not followed by throttle text (no short_description in DOM flow).
          (12) The system respects a non-default max_retries passed at construction by limiting retries to that value.
    WHY: Without throttle detection, error messages would be indexed as
         JD content, corrupting scoring results
