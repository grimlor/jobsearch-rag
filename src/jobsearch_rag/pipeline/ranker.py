"""Score fusion, deduplication, and final ranking.

The Ranker is the bridge between raw scoring outputs and the final ranked
shortlist the operator reviews.  It performs three operations in sequence:

1. **Score fusion** — combine fit / archetype / history scores using
   configurable weights from ``settings.toml`` into a single ``final_score``.
   Disqualified roles are zeroed.

2. **Deduplication** — the same job often appears on multiple boards.
   Exact matches (same ``external_id`` + ``board``) are collapsed
   unconditionally.  Near-duplicates (cosine similarity > 0.95 on
   ``full_text`` embeddings) are collapsed, keeping the highest-scored
   instance and noting which other boards carried it.

3. **Threshold filtering** — roles scoring below ``min_score_threshold``
   are excluded from the final output entirely.
