# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Rubric — Universal evaluation dimensions and signals
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These dimensions apply to ALL job listings regardless of archetype.
# Each dimension defines signals that indicate structural misalignment
# (negative) or alignment (positive) with the candidate's career
# trajectory and preferences.
#
# The negative signals in each dimension are embedded into a
# `negative_signals` ChromaDB collection and used to compute a
# continuous penalty score (negative_score) for every listing.
#
# The positive signals in each dimension are embedded into a
# `global_positive_signals` ChromaDB collection and used to compute
# a continuous culture score (culture_score) — an orthogonal axis
# measuring environment and culture quality.
