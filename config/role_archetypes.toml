name = "AI Systems Engineer / AI Platform Architect"
description = """
Designs and builds the infrastructure, tooling, and architectural patterns
that enable reliable, deterministic, and scalable AI systems. Works across
platform engineering, data engineering, and applied ML to create agentic
workflows, retrieval pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and AI-assisted
developer tooling. Owns the architecture for LLM integration, context
management, safety guardrails, and observability for AI systems. Defines
standards for prompt engineering, model interfaces, vector storage, and
evaluation loops. Operates at Staff/Principal altitude with cross-team
influence and long-horizon design responsibilities.
