Designs and builds the infrastructure, tooling, and architectural patterns
that enable reliable, deterministic, and scalable AI systems. Works across
platform engineering, data engineering, and applied ML to create agentic

developer tooling. Owns the architecture for LLM integration, context
management, safety guardrails, and observability for AI systems. Defines
standards for prompt engineering, model interfaces, vector storage, and
evaluation loops. Operates at Staff/Principal altitude with cross-team

Teaches complex systems thinking and architectural patterns through artifacts —
blog posts, reference implementations, annotated code, architectural decision
records, and focused technical writing. Explains not just how systems work
but why they are designed the way they are. Bridges deep engineering expertise
and developer audiences by building things worth explaining, then explaining
them well. Engages in Q&A, community discussion, and focused technical dialogue;
finds energy in the exchange of ideas rather than performance or presence.
Speaks at conferences and events when the content warrants it, but measures
success through depth of understanding enabled, not reach or adoption metrics.
Operates with autonomy — ideally in small, creative, high-trust environments
or as an independent practitioner. Thrives in async, content-driven work
with low organizational overhead. Avoids roles where community management,
evangelism at scale, or travel volume dominate the workload.
